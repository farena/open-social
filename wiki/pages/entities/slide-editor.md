# Slide editor

Visual editor over the [[entities/structured-slide-pipeline]] JSON model. Lives entirely in the parent frame — never reads the iframe DOM.

## Surface

- **`EditorBody`** — top-level layout: filmstrip on the left, canvas center, properties panel right, toolbar across the top.
- **`SlideCanvas`** — wraps the iframe (which renders `wrapSlideHtml(serialize(slide))`) and an absolutely-positioned overlay. Manages canvas scale and dispatches reducer actions.
- **`SlideOverlay`** — transparent layer that owns hit-testing, selection, drag, and resize. Computes everything from the JSON model and `slide-coords` math helpers.
- **`PropertiesPanel`** — sidebar that switches its controls based on the selected element's `kind` (or shows background / "+ add element" controls when nothing is selected).
- **`LayersPanel`** — z-order list with show/hide.
- **`Toolbar`** — global slide actions (background, add element, undo).
- **`useSlideEditor`** — hook exposing the slide reducer, selection state, and mutation helpers. The single source of state for the editor.
- **`useEditorShortcuts`** — keyboard bindings (delete, undo, arrow-key nudge, escape to clear selection).

## Inline rich text

Text editing inside a `container` element uses Lexical (`@lexical/react`), mounted on demand over the selected element when the user double-clicks. The Lexical state is serialized back into the element's `htmlContent` on blur. See `0e840cd`.

## Drag / resize

Snap to a 4 px grid and to canvas centers (`src/lib/slide-coords.ts`). Out of scope V1: snap to other elements, multi-select, rotation.

## Coordinate transform

Canvas units (e.g. 0..1080) → screen units via `canvasToScreen(point, scale)` and back via `screenToCanvas`. The overlay is rendered at the same scale as the iframe so coordinates align.
